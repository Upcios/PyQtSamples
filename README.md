# PyQtSamples
Some examples written in PyQt, the Python binding for The Qt Company's Qt application framework.

# Minimal Requirements
- Python 3.5.2
- PyQt 5.7 (with PyQtChart, PyQtDataVisualization, PyQtPurchasing)
- Qt Creator (to open .pro but you can also create VS 2015 solution)

## How to install them
You can download **Python** from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.

When the installation is done, we need to install the package **pip** and use it to install **PyQt** and some submodules.
To do this, open a console and write:
```
cd C:\Python35
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
cd C:\Python35\Scripts
pip3 install pyqt5
pip3 install PyQtChat
pip3 install PyQtPurchasing
pip3 install PyQtDataVisualization
``` 

You can download **Qt Creator** from [here](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2) and install it.
